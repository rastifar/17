## Project Overview

This project was created as one of my exercises from a React.js bootcamp that I attended a few years ago.
I have created a React application that fetches a list of items from an API which I had created with MockAPI.io. It uses React Context to store the items and displays them in a list called "All Items". Users can select items to create another list called "Selected Items".



### Libraries and Frameworks
•  Scss: Used for Styling

•  Context: Used for state managment.
